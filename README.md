# 🔐 Security Architecture (Production-Grade)

AI Resume Architect now implements full production-grade security.  
Since this project uses **Vite + React**, all security headers and controls are applied using a `vercel.json` file.

## 🔒 What’s Secured

### 1. Strong Security Headers
Implemented at the Vercel Edge:

- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)  
- X-Frame-Options  
- X-Content-Type-Options  
- Referrer-Policy  
- Permissions-Policy  
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)

### 2. Protection Against:

- Clickjacking  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Code Injection  
- Data Leakage via Referrer  
- Browser Feature Abuse  
- Unauthorized Framing  
- Mixed Content  
- MITM Attacks  

### 3. What This Means for Users
- Every request is HTTPS-only  
- No malicious iframes  
- No MIME-type spoofing  
- No browser permission misuse  
- No script injection  
- Better privacy & safer browsing  
- Enterprise-grade hardening

### 4. How It’s Implemented (vercel.json)
```
{
"headers": [
{
"source": "/(.*)",
"headers": [
{ "key": "Strict-Transport-Security", "value": "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload" },
{ "key": "X-Frame-Options", "value": "DENY" },
{ "key": "X-Content-Type-Options", "value": "nosniff" },
{ "key": "Referrer-Policy", "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" },
{ "key": "Permissions-Policy", "value": "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), usb=()" },
{
"key": "Content-Security-Policy",
"value": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' https:; connect-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self';"
}
]
}
]
}
